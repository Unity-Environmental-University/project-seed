# a template for projects grown with care

This is a seed.

It comes with a way of working, not a way of building.
Clone it when you have something that needs to grow
but doesn't know its shape yet.

## what's here

A CLAUDE.md that orients Claude as a collaborator —
not toward productivity, but toward presence.

A way of asking whether a change is right
before making it.

A README that asks to be replaced by yours.

Nothing else. Nothing that hasn't earned its place.

---

## to begin

```
git clone https://github.com/Unity-Environmental-University/project-seed your-project-name
cd your-project-name
```

Open CLAUDE.md. Find the line that says `This is ___`.
Finish the sentence — not what it does, but what it is.
Let that determine everything else.

---

## tending

Add to CLAUDE.md as the project reveals itself.
Remove what no longer fits.
Replace this README with one that knows what it's become.

---

*Proceed as the way opens.*
