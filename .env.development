# VITE_GM_MODE controls which GM backend is used.
#
#   stub  → GMStub (loud, fake, safe for dev — see src/gm/stub.js)
#   live  → Real GM API (requires VITE_GM_API_URL + VITE_GM_API_KEY)
#
# DO NOT set this to 'live' until src/gm/live.js is implemented.
# The stub will warn loudly in the console if something goes wrong.
