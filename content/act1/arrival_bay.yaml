  The docking collar sighs open and cold light floods in.
  The station smells like recycled air and something older — ozone,
  maybe, or the faint mineral trace of deep space. Your cohort
  shuffles through ahead of you.

  A long corridor stretches forward. To your left, a door marked
  ORIENTATION. Ahead, the corridor curves out of sight.

  Dr. Yuen is already talking.

      is normal; the transit field does something to your inner ear.

      "Research station. Officially. There's an anomaly in the local
      semantic field — language behaves differently out here. Our job
      is to observe and document."

      She pauses, looking at something just past your shoulder.

      "Stay with the group."
