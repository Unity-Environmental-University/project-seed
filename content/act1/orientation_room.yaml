  Tutorial space. Safe, well-lit, slightly over-explained.
  The contrast with the rest of the station should feel deliberate —
  like a stage set that was assembled quickly.
  Archivist Morel is the tutorial NPC: friendly, a little bureaucratic.
  The terminal puzzle here sets the flag that unlocks the relay_room exit
  in corridor_a. The GM may add options to Morel in later acts, but not here.

  The room is bright — aggressively so, after the dim corridor.
  Folding chairs face a projection screen. A few of your cohort
  have already found seats, tablets in hand.

  On the wall: a laminated sheet titled STATION SYSTEMS — QUICK REFERENCE.
  In the corner, a terminal blinks patiently.

  Archivist Morel catches your eye and raises a hand in greeting.

      STATION SYSTEMS — QUICK REFERENCE
      · Rooms are connected by corridors. Some passages require clearance.
      · The terminal in each area logs your activity.
      · If you encounter anomalous output, document it. Do not attempt to correct it.
      · The station does not respond to direct queries. Do not ask it questions.

      A standard interface. It shows a login prompt, then a single blinking line:

        > COHORT 7 REGISTERED. CLEARANCE: LEVEL 1.
          ACCESS GRANTED: COMMON AREAS, ORIENTATION, BAY.
          RELAY ROOM: STAFF ESCORT REQUIRED.

      Below, in smaller text, a line that wasn't in the orientation materials:

        > HELLO.

      "Welcome, welcome. You made it through transit in one piece — that's
      always a good sign. I'm Morel. I'll get you oriented."

      He gestures at the terminal in the corner.

      "When you're ready, log in over there. It'll register your clearance
      and give you access to the common areas. Standard stuff."

      "Old communications hub. Still functional, technically, but the
      output's been — unreliable. We keep it staff-only as a precaution."

      He smiles like this is a completely normal thing to say.

      A brief pause.

      He glances at the terminal. Glances back at you.

      "That's — a display glitch. Happens sometimes with the old hardware."

      He says it without hesitation. He has clearly said it before.

      A long pause. He looks at you carefully.

      "Document it," he says finally. "That's the protocol."

      He doesn't say anything else.
