id: corridor_a
name: Corridor A
act: 1
gmGenerated: false

gm_hint: |
  The first room that feels like the station proper.
  The Relay Room door is locked — requires used_orientation_terminal.
  The GM may inject options for the wall panel interactable in later acts,
  particularly to introduce the Station's presence before Act 2.
  The corridor itself should feel slightly longer than it looks.
  There are no NPCs here by default — the GM may place one if narratively warranted.

  The corridor curves away in both directions. The light here is dimmer —
  panels overhead flicker in a rhythm that almost sounds deliberate.

  To your right, a door marked RELAY ROOM. A keypad beside it glows amber.
  Behind you, the Arrival Bay.
  Ahead, the corridor continues into the station's interior.

  On the wall: a panel of small indicator lights, most of them green.
  One is red. One is a color you don't have a word for.

      The keypad glows amber. You haven't registered your clearance yet.
      Orientation first.

      The lights are labeled in small text below each one.
      Most read NOMINAL. The red one reads RELAY — SIGNAL ANOMALY.
      The other one — the one that isn't quite a color — has no label.
      The space beneath it is blank, as if the label was never printed,
      or was removed, or simply isn't there.

      Someone has written below, in pencil, very small:
      "it changes when you're not looking"

      The handwriting doesn't match anyone on the staff roster.
      You don't know how you know that.
